	- more comments on BackPropagationAlgo::getError
	- added new output functions: LinearFunction (y=m*x+b), WinnerTakeAll,
		Periodic functions: PseudoGauss, Triangle, Sawtooth
	- rename old LinearFunction to RampFunction
	- updated Factory with new output functions
	- added max/minIndex and max/minValue to RealVec
	- added erase method to VectorData
	- added a parameter on saveXML for choosing the precision for real data

	- added norm and normalize for RealMat
	- added LinearComboFunction

  * Bugfixs:
	- fixed a bug in GaussFunction constructor (Propertized version)
	- fixed visibility bug in doxygen comments

======= 0.9.0 Release =======
  * Summary of important changes
	- added an experimental class nnfwString for future Unicode support
	- new version of XML format; small changes for end-users but more improvements for
		people that create new kind of Cluster/Linker for a tighty integration with NNFW
	- added a generic data pointer (void*) to Variant and two template method for accessing it
	- add the method Propertized::convertStringTo for converting the string-type
		Variant readed from XML into the type required by class
	- nnfwMessage replace by a new object-oriented messaging system: nWarning, nError, nFatal
	- NNFW_DEBUG flags is also activated with CMake ReleaseWithDebugInfo build-type
	- renamed RealVec::mul to RealVec::outprod, and bugfixed

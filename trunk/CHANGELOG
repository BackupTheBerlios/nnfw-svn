==== Legend of this File ====
 - Each SVN commit is highlighted by an entry row of following template:

    ==> #revision - dd/mm/yyyy <==

 - Each change comment starts with a symbols indicating the type, followed by
    author name within brakets and the comment:

S <mave> comment goes here

   where S can be one of the following symbols:
    '+' : means that something has been added to NNFW
    '-' : means that something has been dropped from NNFW
    'B' : means a BugFix
    'C' : means that something has been changed (e.g. implementation of a Class or a signature method)
